My name is Charlie Freeman. I live in Smyrna, TN and have a eight year old son named Wyatt. I am looking for opportunities in which allow growth and continued development in a career field that better fits my personal interests. I enjoy learning new skills and applying them in my daily routine. In my free time I love puzzles, board games, social events, and playing sports or being outdoors with my son. In my professional life I am committed to achieving a standard that exceeds what is set by my employer. I continue to learn and improve on whatever it is I am currently working on.  I have always taken an intrest in computers and engineering. In highschool I took three different elective classes in computer hardware and networking. I was also on the Robotics and Math team. I took two different classes in college that pertained to coding one was MatLab. The other was in material analysis where we used excell to collect and analyze data sets on different materials to determine specific properites. In school I took more interest in physics and math. As technology has progressed and coding has become an intergal part of all engineering fields so has my interest in this field. I am especially interested in machine learning, data management, and robotics. The coding I have covered up to this point I enjoy the most is back-end code such as SQL and MongoDB. Front-end code has been quicker for me to learn and utilize.
